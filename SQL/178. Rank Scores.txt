/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

select Score, dense_rank() over(order by Score desc) as Rank from Scores


2nd solution without dense_rank
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
select Score, rank from Scores join
(select T2.Id, count(distinct T1.Score) as rank from Scores T2 join
(select distinct Score from Scores) T1 on T2.Score <= T1.Score
group by T2.Id) T3 on Scores.Id= T3.Id
order by rank
